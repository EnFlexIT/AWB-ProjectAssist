**Awb-Assist** enables you to create a new project based on an existing blueprint.  
To do so, certain parameters must be provided as arguments in **key/value sets**, with each key preceded by a `-`.

## Example Arguments
Below is an example of how the arguments should look:
-blueprint "TestingAgent" -bundleName "FlexAqua Assistant Agent" -symBunName "de.enflexit.flexAqua.assistantAgent" -targetDir "D:"

In this example:
- **`bundleName`**, **`symBundleName`**, and **`targetDir`** were needed to create a project with a structure similar to the blueprint **TestingAgent**.
