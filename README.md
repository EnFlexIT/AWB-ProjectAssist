# Development Tools for Agent.Workbench

Here we manage the projects that - later on - serve as developer tools and thus should increase the development speed  
for individual Agent.Workbench projects and its extensions. The projects available are:
- ***de.enflexit.awbAssist.core:*** with this Maven Plugin, project bluprints will be used to produce new Plug-in Projects.  
For further information visit the corresponding [README.md](/de.enflexit.awbAssist.core/README.md). 
- ***de.enflexit.tools:*** with this Eclipse feature, project generation and other will be integrated into the Eclipse IDE.
